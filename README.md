## Overview
This project is about analyzing data from a personal activity monitoring device.This device collects data at 5 minute intervals through out the day.   
The data consists of two months of data from an anonymous individual collected during the months of October and November, 2012 and include the number of steps taken in 5 minute intervals each day.  

The data for this assignment can be downloaded from the course web site:   
*Dataset* : [Activity monitoring data](https://d396qusza40orc.cloudfront.net/repdata%2Fdata%2Factivity.zip) 

The variables included in this dataset are:  
- *steps*: Number of steps taking in a 5-minute interval  
- *date*: The date on which the measurement was taken in YYYY-MM-DD format  
- *interval*: Identifier for the 5-minute interval in which measurement was taken  

The dataset is stored in a comma-separated-value (CSV) file and there are a total of 17,568 observations in this dataset.

### Strategy for imputing NULL values
Impute null values of steps with the mean number of steps taken in interval corresponding to null values
